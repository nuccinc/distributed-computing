# NUCC Distributed Computing to Aid in COVID-19 Research

**Latest Update: March 25, 2020**

Join [The National Upcycled Computing Collective (NUCC)](https://www.nuccinc.org/) in a collaborative effort to combine our resources in order to aid in COVID-19 research.
This project draws heavily from [BOINC's default Docker configurations](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc-client-docker).
The difference is that without registering for any accounts or sharing any personal information, you will automatically be connected to NUCC's ongoing [Rosetta@home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/)
folding research team that is actively processing COVID-19-specific workloads.

---

### The fastest and easiest way to contribute if you already have Docker installed:

Copy/paste the following one-liner to get started immediately on MacOS or Linux:

`docker run -d --restart always --name boinc -p 31416 -v "${HOME}/.boinc:/var/lib/boinc" -e BOINC_GUI_RPC_PASSWORD="123" -e BOINC_CMD_LINE_OPTIONS="--allow_remote_gui_rpc --attach_project http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/ 2108683_fdd846588bee255b50901b8b678d52ec" boinc/client:baseimage-alpine`

## Windows Native Installation:

Download the zip file of the repository, unzip it, and run `quickstart.bat --native --attach` from an elevated (Administrator) command prompt.

Alternatively, if you have `git` installed, launch an elevated (Administrator) command promt and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/phx/nucc.git
cd nucc
quickstart.bat --native --attach
```

This will install the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, which will then install BOINC.

BOINC Manager will automatically launch, at which point you will wait for the *Select a Project* window to pop up.

Cancel out of that window, confirm, and hit [Enter] to continue running the script.

It will automatically connect to the correct project and start processing workloads immediately.

## Windows Docker Installation:

Download the zip file of the repository, unzip it, and run `quickstart.bat` from an elevated (Administrator) command prompt.

Alternatively, if you have `git` installed, launch an elevated (Administrator) command promt and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/phx/nucc.git
cd nucc
quickstart.bat --docker
```

This will install the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, which will then install Docker Desktop.

When Docker Desktop is launched for the first time, you will need to log out and log back in for it to finish starting up.

- Right-click the Docker icon in the taskbar
- Go to Preferences > Resources > Filesharing
- Check to enable the C drive
- Click "Apply and Restart"
- Wait for Docker to *completely* finish restarting
- Run `quickstart.bat --docker` again from an elevated prompt to start processing workloads immediately

*When running the Docker image for the first time, Windows will ask to confirm if Docker can access your C drive.*

## BSD Jail Installation

**[Documentation for FreeBSD (specifically, FreeNAS) can be found in this blog post](https://bookandcode.com/nuccbsd)**.

If you have any trouble, reach out to me on Discord (if you know me), submit an issue, or leave a comment on the post.

## Linux and MacOS Docker Installation

### If you don't currently have Docker installed:

- MacOS 10.8+
- Ubuntu
- Debian 8+
- Raspbian 8+
- CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
- Fedora 30+
- Kali 2018+ (based on Debian Stretch)
- Arch

```
git clone http://github.com/phx/nucc.git
cd nucc
./quickstart.sh
```

*If the script errors out after installing Docker, run it again in a new login shell that recognizes your user as a member of the `docker` group, and you should be squared away.*

### If you already have Docker installed:

```
git clone http://github.com/phx/nucc.git
cd nucc
./quickstart.sh
```

#### Firewall Caveats:

If you are running `firewalld` or `ufw` or something like that, you will need to either create a rule for the `docker0` interface on port `31416`.

Alternately, you can disable the service altogether by running `systemctl disable firewalld` (etc.), and then rebooting.

This is necessary to be able to resolve DNS inside the containers.

If you have already installed and spun up a container via `quickstart.sh`, just implement the firewall rules and run `docker restart boinc`.

If you disable the firewall completely, the `boinc` container should spin up immediately after reboot and will be able to process workloads successfully.

## Supported Architectures and Tags

You can specialize the `boinc/client` image with any of the following tags to use one of the specialized container version instead.

These can be used in the Linux/MacOS one-liner at the top of this page or passed as the `$IMG` environment variable to `quickstart.sh`.

## Docker Swarm Mode

You can use a Docker Swarm to launch a large number of clients, for example across a cluster that you are using for BOINC computation. First, start the swarm and create a network,

```sh
docker swarm init
docker network create -d overlay --attachable boinc
```

If you want, you can connect other nodes to your swarm by running the appropriate `docker swarm join` command on worker nodes as prompted above (although you can just run on one node too).

Then launch your clients:

```sh
docker service create \
  --replicas <N> \
  --name boinc \
  --network=boinc \
  -p 31416 \
  -e BOINC_GUI_RPC_PASSWORD="123" \
  -e BOINC_CMD_LINE_OPTIONS="--allow_remote_gui_rpc --attach_project http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/ 2108683_fdd846588bee255b50901b8b678d52ec" \
  boinc/client
```

You now have `<N>` clients running, distributed across your swarm. You can issue commands to all of your clients via, 

```sh
docker run --rm --network boinc boinc/client boinccmd_swarm --passwd 123 <args>
```

Note you do not need to specify `--host`. The `boinccmd_swarm` command takes care of sending the command to each of the hosts in your swarm.

Docker Swarm does not support `pid=host` mode. As a result, client settings related to non-boinc CPU usage or exclusion apps will not take effect.

## Updates:

- Added Centos/RHEL/Amazon Linux support for [The Almost Universal Docker Installer](https://github.com/phx/dockerinstall), which is used by [`quickstart.sh`](quickstart.sh).
- Documentation on remotely monitoring and managing workloads is in the works.
- The last feature to be added will be shortcut commands to interact with containers.
